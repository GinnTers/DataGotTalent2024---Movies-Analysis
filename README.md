Unlocking insights from raw data to actionable strategies through preprocessing, visualization, and storytelling.

## Introduction

A competition held at Da Nang University of Economics. Data Got Talent is more than just a playground; it is a journey to discover exceptional talent in data analytics. It offers students a platform to shine and an opportunity to learn and grow their skills.

This project was developed as part of the **DataGotTalent 2024** competition, where participants are challenged to transform raw business datasets into compelling data stories. The dataset revolves around the movie industry, capturing transactional and customer information related to movie ticket sales. 

In this project, I performed extensive data preprocessing using **Excel** and **Python (Pandas, NumPy)** to clean and reshape the original dataset. The processed data was then visualized using **Power BI**, where I built an interactive dashboard to explore patterns, trends, and revenue insights.

The goal was to identify key drivers of movie revenue and provide data-driven decisions for business improvement. A complete set of **insights** and **recommendations** has been documented in the attached PDF report.

## Dataset

### Source
The dataset was provided by the DataGotTalent competition committee. It consists of transactional records from a fictional movie ticketing system, combining information from three key tables: **Customer**, **Film**, and **Ticket**.

### Key Columns (after preprocessing)
- `customerid`: Unique customer ID  
- `DOB`, `gender`, `job`: Customer demographics  
- `show_id`, `title`, `director`, `cast`, `release_year`, `country`: Film details  
- `orderid`, `ticketcode`, `saledate`, `total`, `cashier`: Ticket sales transaction details

The raw dataset required significant cleaning due to mixed header rows, multilingual labeling (Vietnamese + English), and table segmentation.
